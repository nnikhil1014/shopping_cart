<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a simple shopping cart web app built with React and Redux. The project demonstrates the implementation of a basic e-commerce workflow, including product listing, adding products to the cart, and viewing the cart summary. It focuses on using modern React features such as useState, useEffect, and Redux for state management.

This project was inspired by my learning journey and hands-on practice with modern web technologies. It is a great demonstration of integrating React with Redux and making API calls to fetch and manage data dynamically.
